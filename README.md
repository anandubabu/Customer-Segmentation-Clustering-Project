# Customer Segmentation Clustering Project

## Overview
This project focuses on using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Clustering to group customers into distinct segments. By doing so, we aim to reveal valuable insights about customer behaviors and preferences that can inform marketing strategies and improve customer experiences.

## Importing Libraries
In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and clustering. These libraries include NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Yellowbrick.

## Dataset
We load the dataset from a CSV file using pandas. The dataset contains information about customers, including their demographic data, purchase history, and response to marketing campaigns.

## Data Cleaning
We perform data cleaning by checking for missing values and duplicates. In this project, we handle a small number of missing values by removing rows with missing data.

## Feature Engineering
We create new features based on the existing data, such as the total amount spent by customers, the number of children in the family, and the age of customers. We also transform and encode categorical variables into numerical format.

## Data Preprocessing
This section covers the preprocessing steps, including encoding categorical features and handling outliers. We use LabelEncoder to transform categorical variables and remove outliers from the dataset.

## Feature Scaling
We standardize the features using the StandardScaler to ensure that all variables have the same scale, making them suitable for clustering.

## Clustering
The actual clustering process is performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Agglomerative Clustering to group customers into distinct segments.

## Results and Insights
We analyze the results of the clustering, such as the identified customer segments, and extract valuable insights about customer behavior and preferences.

## Conclusion
In the conclusion, we summarize the key findings and insights from the project. We also discuss potential applications and recommendations for marketing strategies and customer experience improvements.
